# Text-to-Video Synthesis using ModelScope

This repository contains code for generating videos from text using the Text-to-Video Synthesis model from ModelScope. With this model, you can input text and get a corresponding video as output.

## Usage

### Google Colab

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the following code snippet in your Colab notebook to install the required dependencies and set up the environment:

```python
!pip install modelscope==1.4.2
!pip install open_clip_torch
!pip install pytorch-lightning
!pip install gradio
```
- Run the code cells in the notebook to download the necessary model files and define the text-to-video synthesis function.

- After running the setup code, a user interface will appear where you can enter text to generate a corresponding video.

- Enter your desired text and click the "Generate Video" button to see the output video(it may take a bit of time).

### Notes
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the documentation of the libraries used in this repository.
- Enjoy exploring the capabilities of text-to-video synthesis!
